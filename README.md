I built a html page from scratch.
I tied in a css page and built out some styles.
I added in a javascript page and got everything connected and up and running.

I will eventually add some variations to the style sheets and have like 3 different styles and designs but the same format just to get practice doing more css.

In the future, I will probably use this as a starting point for future projects for my future clients, just chaning up the content and design.
